# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Description

This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. Players take turns to place their mark (`X` or `O`) on a 3x3 board. The game continues until one player wins by aligning three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the board is full and the game ends in a tie.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against another player on the same computer.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that players choose valid moves.
- **Board Display**: Shows the current state of the game board after each move.
- **Winner Detection**: Determines if there's a winner or if the game ends in a tie.
